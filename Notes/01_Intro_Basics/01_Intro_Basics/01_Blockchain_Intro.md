# What is Blockchain?

- A **blockchain** is like a digital ledger.
    
- It stores information in **blocks** linked in a **chain**.
    
- Once data is added to the chain, it **can’t be changed**.
    
- It’s **decentralized**—no single person or company controls it.

## Key Features

- **Decentralization**: No central authority.
    
- **Transparency**: Everyone can see the data.
    
- **Immutability**: Data can’t be changed once added.
    
- **Consensus**: Rules for agreeing on changes.

## How It Works

1. A user requests a transaction.
    
2. The transaction is sent to the network.
    
3. Nodes validate it using **consensus algorithms** (like Proof of Work).
    
4. The valid transaction is added to a block.
    
5. The block is added to the chain.

## Example

```text
[Block 1] --> [Block 2] --> [Block 3]
Each block contains:
- Data
- Hash
- Previous block's hash
```
